            Farming
            Building
            Labor
    Resource Use:
        1 food per month

Jobs: - points counted at the end of the turn.
    Farmer
        Steps:
            in April, click plots to plant (change from empty to _1) - 10 points needed
            May, June, July, August, September - 10 points each month
            October, switchs from _3 to _4, 10 points required. 
            Food shows up beginning of November turn.
        Automatically assigns available points to farmland. 
        Farmers work together to finish farmland tiles. There should never be multiple fields partially tilled.
    Builder
        Automatically starts working on the highest priority building under construction (usually the first one you placed)
        Any extra points go to the next highest priority building.
        Multiple builders speed up the process
    Laborer
        Will automatically chop down trees randomly.
   

Buildings:
    House
        is "in construction" stage as soon as you build it. 
        Can be placed on space with trees, but will add 2 build points to total required per tree. Trees will dissapear and construction sight will appear, but wood will not be added until beginning of next month.
        20 build points. (one builder = two months, two builders = one month)
        5 Wood
        Can house 4 peeps
    Farmland
        Doesn't require builders. Built immediately. Farmers can be assigned that month.
        Must be placed on space with no trees
        Can have one peep assigned per farm tile.
        10 farm points required every month for April, May, June, July, August, September, October in order to stay alive.
        Produces 18 food in October
